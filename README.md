# IntensiveStatePropPureSub
This repository contains the MATLAB codes to deduce intensive state properties of a pure substance using digital tables, given two independent state properties. The repository also contains user manual which guides you how to provide the inputs. 
The project was a result of collaborative effort of six students at IIT Gandhinagar.
1. Ayush Agarwal, Discipline of Materials Science and Engineering
2. Dhvani Shah, Discipline of Mechanical Engineering
3. Hiral Sharma, Discipline of Chemical Engineering
4. Shreyshi Singh, Discipline of Computer Science and Engineering
5. Siddhi Surawar, Discipline of Materials Science and Engineering
6. Somesh Pratap Singh, Discipline of Mechanical Engineering & Computer Science and Engineering

We would like to thank Prof. Atul Bhargav, Prof. Uddipta Ghosh, and all the TAs for guiding us throughout the project and providing us with all the assistance needed.
